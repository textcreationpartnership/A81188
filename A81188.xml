            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They have taken the Iſle of Cockes and the Garriſon thereof, with ſeventy Commanders and other common Souldiers: ſeven peeces of Ordnance, and all their ammunition, and have placed a Garriſon of their owne men therein.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of that Countie come into them daily, and the more becauſe the Centrie of the Countrie join with them and take the Covenant, ſo that indeed all Northumberland is prettie well redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the obedience of the King, and Parliament; Newcaſtle, Tinmouth, and the Sheelds only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which it is verie probable by this time are in their hands too, eſpecially Newcaſtle.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:154569:3"/>
            <p>The Scots lie quattered about Morpeth, Seaton, Hepam: Ogle Caſtle; Prude, and thoſe parts about Newcaſtle: and have laid a ſtrong ſiege about New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle alſo: and ly cloſe under the verie Walls, the Malignants are for the moſt part all of them gone into Newcaſtle, when they firſt heard of the Scots approach, whether they carried ſuch treaſure and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goods as they moſt eſteemed: There is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie whether Generall King be in Newcaſtle or not, but the Scots had beſieged it eight days: which is to this time above a fortnight: There are a great number in the Town; but they wiſh that all New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtles Army was there, that they might make ſhort work with them, for they did not expect the taking of Newcaſtle to be much troubleſome to them.</p>
            <p>Generall Leſley ſent a Meſſenger to the Towne to the Governour thereof: to require to the delivery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to him: for the uſe of the King, and Parliament, and that for their ſo doing, the Town ſhould be free from plunder, and themſelves in perſon ſecured; with other propoſitions as was by the Generall thought fit.</p>
            <p>The Meſſenger having delivered his Meſſage to Col. Glenham, who received it in the name of the Town, the Town was ſummoned, and a parlie was held concerning the ſame, and it was agreed upon, that an anſwer ſhould be returned to Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This anſwer being brought to Generall Leſley he was very willing to condiſcend thereunto, and the more rather becauſe hee had not then his murthering pieces ready, by reaſon the ilneſſe of the wayes hindred them, but by that time (at the fartheſt) he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected them, reſolving that if they would not deliver up the Town the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y would ſtorme it, but it was then believed by the Scots Armie that it would be ſurrendred to them, ſo that there is no queſtion but that by this time it is in their hands.</p>
            <p>And as for the Shields they are not yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but being only but houſes they doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that it will bee no great matter to take them, they can doe it when they liſt, The greateſt matter next unto the taking of New caſtle Town, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>They doe carry themſelves ſo ſivelly and

            <p>The Ships that were laden in the channel with malignants goods, were ſtopt in by 4 Parliament Ships which the vice Admirall appointed to ly before Tinmouth, but the laſt weeke about Thuaſday and Friday there fell ſuch ſtormes that our ſhips could not ride there, but were forced to ſale away from thence for fear of being ſhipwrackt, at which time they took their oportunity, and ſaled out of the channell, and have carried away their fraught, it is ſuppoſed for Holland.</p>
